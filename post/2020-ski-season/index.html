<a class=tag href=https://alexnorell.com/categories/skiing/>Skiing</a></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>This was the first year I got back into skiing after graduating from college, and my wife and I decided to get Mountain Collective passes. We figured this would motivate us to explore and experience a variety of resorts instead of just sticking to our usual routine of driving up to Tahoe. It was an exciting way to jump back into my love for skiing while also turning it into an adventure for both of us.</p><h2 id=the-plan>The plan</h2><ul><li>Travel to new mountains, exploring different terrains and scenic views.</li><li>Demo a variety of skis to find the perfect pair to buy.</li><li>Celebrate getting married with a memorable trip to Canada</li></ul><h2 id=ski-trip-log>Ski Trip Log</h2><p>This is a year of firsts for us, thanks to the Mountain Collective pass encouraging us to travel. Out of the 11 mountains I visited, 9 were completely new experiences for me. This pass really pushed us out of our comfort zone, leading to a season filled with exciting new discoveries and unforgettable trips.</p><div class=ski-stats-container><table class=ski-stats-table><tr><td class=ski-stats-title>Days</td><td class=ski-stats-title>Mountains</td><td class=ski-stats-title>Vertical Feet</td></tr><tr><td class=ski-stats-value>20</td><td class=ski-stats-value>11</td><td class=ski-stats-value>N/A</td></tr></table></div><h3 id=overnight-trip-to-tahoe>Overnight trip to Tahoe</h3><p>We did a quick trip up to Tahoe to demo some skis and get some new equipment.

<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>First time skiing on new boots. Demoed Volkl Mantras and Head Kore 99s and learned the Kore 99s are a very stiff ski.

We flew into Salt Lake City, rented a car, and stayed at the Hampton Inn in Sandy.</p><div class=expandable-box><div class=expandable-header onclick=toggleExpand(this)><span>January 16 - Snowbird, UT</span>
<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>First time at the bird and Snowbird instantly became a favorite. Stormy weather. Demoed some Dynastar skis that I wasn't a fan of.

<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>First time at Alta and also became a favorite along with Snowbird. Definitely liked the terrain more at Alta though. Demoed Fisher Ranger 107Tis. Tried to buy them from the shop, but was told no.

<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>Spent most of my time lapping high traverse and ballroom.

We happened to go to Aspen during the X Games. We flew into Denver, rented a car, and drove to Aspen. We ended up staying at the Wildwood in Snowmass the first night, and the Viewline Resort the second night. Both of these were slope-side at Snowmass. We left Aspen and had to drive all the way down to Golden for a reasonably priced hotel for night 3. Our forth night, we were able to stay on the correct side of the Eisenhower tunnel at the Super 8 in Dillon. Our last night was at the Westin at the airport to make it easier to make our 6 am flight home.</p><div class=expandable-box><div class=expandable-header onclick=toggleExpand(this)><span>January 24 - Snowmass, CO</span>
<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>First time at Aspen. Not as steep as I would have liked, but still a fun mountain.

<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>We stayed slopeside, so didn't have a reason to go to any of the other Aspen mountains.

<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>First time at The Legend. Immediately became my favorite Colorado mountain. Demoed some Blizzard Brahmas.

<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>Demoed some Enforcers again.

I stayed at the Donner Lake Village in Truckee.</p><div class=expandable-box><div class=expandable-header onclick=toggleExpand(this)><span>February 2 - Palisades, CA</span>
<span class=arrow>&#9654;</span></div><div class=expandable-content>I pulled the trigger on getting a set of skis that I really enjoyed skiing and was accustomed to, the Volkl Mantra 102. It skied very similar to the Volkl Mantras that I had been skiing for 10 years at that point, but it was a bit wider allowing for a bit more flotation.</div></div><h3 id=taos-trip>Taos Trip</h3><p>First time ever to New Mexico and first time ever to the magical mountain that is Taos Ski Valley. We flew into Albuquerque, rented a car, and drove up to Taos. The first two nights we stayed Worldmark Taos. The last night, we ended up at the Super 8 near the Airport in Albuquerque.</p><div class=expandable-box><div class=expandable-header onclick=toggleExpand(this)><span>February 8 - Taos, NM</span>

We got some amazing fresh powder.</div></div><h3 id=canada-trip>Canada Trip</h3><p>Part of the reason to get the Mountain Collective pass was to ski in Canada, and to travel to Banff. We flew into Calgary, rented a car and drove straight to Revelstoke to start the trip off. We spent two nights at the Sandman Hotel and then drove back towards Calgary to spend an entire week at the Banff Warm Springs Hotel. We stayed at the Airport Marriott on the way out to make our 6 AM flight back home.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2020-ski-season/images/revelstoke.webp title=Revelstoke class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2020-ski-season/images/revelstoke_hu2bbb0a21c4e2fed5c99d941af9c581c2_66108_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Overlooking the Colombia River from the top of Revelstoke" title=Revelstoke>

Boarding the plane on Saturday afternoon, everything seemed fine, and COVID-19 wasn&rsquo;t a major concern. However, by the time we landed in Salt Lake City on March 14th, most mountains had closed, though Jackson Hole remained open. A weather delay caused our flight to Jackson to be postponed by a couple of hours. We eventually took off, flew to Jackson, circled the city for an hour, and then had to return to Salt Lake City due to a storm. Upon landing back in Salt Lake City, Jackson had completely shut down as well. We had Delta put us on a flight back to San Jose instead of attempting to get us to Jackson.</p><p>That marked the end of our season. We had additional plans to visit Bozeman, MT, for Big Sky and drive down to Mammoth Lakes for Mammoth, but those trips were canceled as well.</p><h2 id=ski-gear>Ski Gear</h2><p>I ended up replacing almost everything by the end of the season. The pieces that were not replaced: poles, jacket, gloves, socks, base layers.</p><h3 id=skis-and-bindings>Skis and Bindings</h3><p>I demoed over 10 different skis before I settled on buying the Volkl Mantra 102. I paired them with a set of Look Pivot 14s. The things that really stuck out to me about these skis is the power they had when ripping down groomers. We were skiing groomers a majority of the time since that is what Mariah enjoys skiing and these were a blast to ski. They were still wide enough to enjoy the softer stuff with fresh snow.</p><h4 id=2020-volkl-mantra-102>2020 Volkl Mantra 102</h4><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2020-ski-season/images/volkl_mantra_102.webp title="Volkl Mantra 102" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2020-ski-season/images/volkl_mantra_102_hu3c7c7dc30a74d5b22fb26e17a34d1552_37180_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="A pair of Volkl Mantra Skis" title="Volkl Mantra 102">

I was looking for a stiff boot and something that felt like my Salomon Ghost 130 boots that I had been skiing on for almost a decade. The Ghost boots were a 2 buckle boot, 2 piece boot with a zip lacing system similar to a snowboard boot that really cinched down on my foot and held me in. The Panterra is a 3 buckle, 3 piece boot. I like the way they felt in the store and the similar design.</p><p>After the second day, I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the fit of the boots and the control I was getting. I went to a boot fitter in Snowbird and got some punch work done and also ended up buying Zipfits to give me a more connected feeling with my boot. I will probably never ski in a boot without my Zipfits again.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2020-ski-season/images/dalbello_panterra_120_gw.webp title="Dalbello Panterra 120" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2020-ski-season/images/dalbello_panterra_120_gw_hu5ab81b650162ee3bc558cac9b118fe6f_8176_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="A side profile of the Dalbello Panterra 120 GW Boot." title="Dalbello Panterra 120">

These things are super durable and have never let me down. They&rsquo;re made from composite material, so they flex and bend under pressure instead of snapping like aluminum poles. They&rsquo;re lightweight and easy to handle, which is great for everything from casual runs to more aggressive skiing. Honestly, they&rsquo;ve held up so well over the years and still perform like champs every season.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2020-ski-season/images/goode_gmax_poles.webp title="Goode G-Max Poles" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2020-ski-season/images/goode_gmax_poles_hu96be471341e7d5f25263e73a5943f31a_7050_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Goode G-Max Poles showing grips basket and pole." title="Goode G-Max Poles">

It was probably aged out by this time too and no longer safe. I wanted something that had adjustable vents as well as MIPS and tried a bunch of helmets on. I ended up going with the Smith Vantage and really enjoyed it all season.</p><p>After a the first couple days, it was clear that I also needed new goggle. My previous ones were all scratched up and I couldn&rsquo;t see much out of them. I picked up a pair of Smith 4DMags in Snowbird and really love them. They give a huge field of view and the replaceable lenses give a ton of flexibility for different light conditions.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2020-ski-season/images/smith_vantage_mips_ski_helmet.webp title="Smith Vantage MIPS" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2020-ski-season/images/smith_vantage_mips_ski_helmet_huc9f09b34504078e903edf05199a4a819_17554_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Black Smith Vantage MIPS ski helmet" title="Smith Vantage MIPS">

I didn&rsquo;t change that this year, but I needed to get a new pair of paints, and also get something with a few more pockets. I picked up a pair of 686 Quantum Thermagraph Insulated Pants before the first day up, and then got a Recco enabled belt in Colorado.</p><p>The brown jacket this year was the one I had been skiing in since 2012, a North Face Decagon Jacket.</p><p>My gloves were still good and I had no reason to change them up.
