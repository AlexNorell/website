It was awesome to spend so much time on the road and really learn what we like and don&rsquo;t like.</p><p>I switched my pass this year to the Ikon Pass to get more days at the places I love and to expand the number of places that I am able to ski. It also didn&rsquo;t help that Altera removed their mountains from the Mountain Collective pass, taking away all the California mountains. I also felt a bit limited in the number of days I could ski with the Mountain Collective pass, only getting 2 days at each of the partner resorts. Ikon gave me unlimited at the Altera owned mountains and 7 days at the rest of the mountains I would want to ski.</p><p>Mariah stayed with the Mountain Collective, since she wasn&rsquo;t planning on coming on the whole road trip, but just flying in for a weekend at a time to join me. This worked out well, since it forced me to move around more than I would have otherwise.</p><h2 id=the-plan>The Plan</h2><p>This year&rsquo;s plan was to do a road trip on an even bigger scale than last year, with at least 2 months on the road and getting more days on the mountain.</p><ul><li>Fly to Denver to ski with friends in Colorado</li><li>Fly to Boise to pick up my truck</li><li>Get back to Denver by the end of February for a conference</li><li>Mariah would fly in and ski parts of the trip, but wasn&rsquo;t road tripping</li><li>Slowly make my way back to California by the beginning of April</li><li>Ski a bunch in California</li></ul><h2 id=ski-trip-log>Ski Trip Log</h2><p>I was able to make it to more mountains in a year than I have ever before and also ski at seven new mountain.</p><div class=ski-stats-container><table class=ski-stats-table><tr><td class=ski-stats-title>Days</td><td class=ski-stats-title>Mountains</td><td class=ski-stats-title>Vertical Feet</td></tr><tr><td class=ski-stats-value>43</td><td class=ski-stats-value>19</td><td class=ski-stats-value>546.3K</td></tr></table></div><h3 id=taos>Taos</h3><p>We flew out to New Mexico to bring my dad back to Taos. The last time he was there was in the late 80s. We had a lot of fun showing him the city and the mountain.</p><p>A huge storm rolled in overnight for day 2 and multiple inches of fresh snow fell. I unfortunately forgot to pack enough contacts and couldn&rsquo;t ski. We got a late start getting up to the mountain so Mariah and my dad could ski. When we got there, the storm was still dumping snow. The winds were high and the temperature was low, so they only lasted 90 minutes before calling it quits.</p><div class=expandable><div class=expandable-box id="expandable-January 14 - Taos Ski Valley, NM"><div class=expandable-header onclick=toggleExpand(this)><div class=header-content><span class=header-title>January 14 - Taos Ski Valley, NM</span>

During this time, some co-workers and Mariah came into town separately to ski.</p><p>With my change to the Ikon pass this year, I was able to try out a bunch of resorts in Salt Lake City that I wasn&rsquo;t able to in the past. This gave me a reason to spend time up in Ogden to try out Snowbasin. Snowbasin was a such a welcome surprise, with it not being crowded at all and having great snow and terrain.</p><p>I was also able to venture up the Big Cottonwood Canyon for the first time to try out Brighton and Solitude. While I still prefer the Little Cottonwood Canyon more, Solitude has some very fun steeps, and I lucked out with a huge powder day.</p><p>For my final day in the Salt Lake City area I headed over to Park City and skied at Deer Valley.

Here&rsquo;s the gear that made it possible for me to enjoy this season.</p><h3 id=skis-and-bindings>Skis and Bindings</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve been skiing on Volkl Mantra 102s with Look Pivot 14 bindings for the last 4 seasons. They still tackled everything I threw at them and then some. From ripping down groomers at high speed to getting into the fresh stuff after a storm, they handled it all beautifully.</p><p>Holding me to the skis the Look Pivot 14 bindings that have been flawless this entire time. They can be a bit difficult to reset after a fall, but they continue to give me the ski feel I am looking for as I slide down the mountain.</p><h4 id=2020-volkl-mantra-102>2020 Volkl Mantra 102</h4><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2023-ski-season/images/volkl_mantra_102.webp title="Volkl Mantra 102" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2023-ski-season/images/volkl_mantra_102_hu3c7c7dc30a74d5b22fb26e17a34d1552_37180_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="A pair of Volkl Mantra Skis" title="Volkl Mantra 102" width=250px height=250px>

My feet hurt a couple more times this season than last season, but everything seemed to work out if I kept my boots tight.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2023-ski-season/images/dalbello_panterra_120_gw.webp title="Dalbello Panterra 120" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2023-ski-season/images/dalbello_panterra_120_gw_hu5ab81b650162ee3bc558cac9b118fe6f_8176_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="A side profile of the Dalbello Panterra 120 GW Boot." title="Dalbello Panterra 120" width=250px height=250px>

These poles are made out of a composite material that allows them to flex and feel almost indestructible. They are light weight and have handled every ski season I&rsquo;ve used them since 2008.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2023-ski-season/images/goode_gmax_poles.webp title="Goode G-Max Poles" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2023-ski-season/images/goode_gmax_poles_hu96be471341e7d5f25263e73a5943f31a_7050_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Goode G-Max Poles showing grips basket and pole." title="Goode G-Max Poles" width=250px height=250px>
<span>Goode G-Max Poles</span></a></li></ul><h3 id=helmet-and-goggles>Helmet and Goggles</h3><p>My goggles and Helmet didn&rsquo;t change this year either. I did end up picking up couple more lenses for the goggles before the season started to be more adaptable to different sun conditions.</p><p>I&rsquo;m skiing with a Smith Vantage MIPS helmet and Smith 4D Mag Goggles. These form a great system with a ton of ventilation and protection. The goggles give almost 100% peripheral view, with most of the gain in the vertical direction. MIPS technology in the helmet is designed to help protect your brain during a twisting fall by allowing the interior of the helmet to twist at a different rate than the exterior. Thankfully I haven&rsquo;t had any big falls with my helmet yet, so I should be good to continue using it for the foreseeable future.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2023-ski-season/images/smith_vantage_mips_ski_helmet.webp title="Smith Vantage MIPS" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2023-ski-season/images/smith_vantage_mips_ski_helmet_huc9f09b34504078e903edf05199a4a819_17554_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Black Smith Vantage MIPS ski helmet" title="Smith Vantage MIPS" width=250px height=250px>

<span>Smith 4D Mag goggles</span></a></li></ul><h3 id=outer-layer>Outer Layer</h3><p>Between seasons I replaced almost my entire outerlayer system. I switched from my 686 Quantum Thermagraph pants to Flylow Baker Bibs. Having never skied in bibs before I just thought the normal operating behavior was snow going down your back in big pow days or during a fall. Little did I know the life changing magic of snow bibs. They&rsquo;re an overall that keeps snow out of your clothes and also add a ton of extra usable pockets. They&rsquo;ve got a thigh pocket where I keep my Balaclava just in case I need it, and chest pockets where I keep my car keys, snacks and anything else I want to keep warm or safe inside my jacket.</p><p>For the jacket, I picked up a Backcountry Cottonwoods jacket. This is only a shell, but it is made of burly gore-tex fabric and feels very strong. I also got a jacket that had the pockets in the places that I wanted them, and didn&rsquo;t have a bunch of additional pockets. My requirements for pockets in a jacket is an exterior chest pocket for my phone, an additional exterior chest pocket for my goggles cleaning cloth, hand pockets for any additional things like snacks or trail maps, arm pocket for a pass, and vents to dump heat. Switching to only a shell gave me lot more control of how hot or cold I was going to be on any given day.</p><p>While in Utah the first time I did pick up an additional jacket that I use for extremely cold days, the Flylow Roswell Insulated jacket. I didn&rsquo;t get to wear this much during the season, but when I did, I was definitely warm and stayed warmer than I could accomplish with my down jacket and base layers.</p><p>Keeping my hands warm has always been a problem for me and I&rsquo;ve been very happy with the gloves I bought last year, Hestra Fall Line Three Finger gloves. I also added in a pair of Hestra Ergo Grip Active gloves for warmer weather. They are a much thinner glove and the back is polyester to really aid in ventilation. I didn&rsquo;t expect to use them as much as I did, but they give a ton of dexterity and were a perfect temperature for nice days.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2023-ski-season/images/backcountry_jacket.webp title="Backcountry Cottonwoods Jacket" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2023-ski-season/images/backcountry_jacket_hu0887a3d4b471af681b5cbae0d4c3b076_8488_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Backcountry Cottonwoods Jacket in Eggplant color" title="Backcountry Cottonwoods Jacket" width=250px height=250px>

<span>Hestra Ergo Active Gloves</span></a></li></ul><h3 id=base-layers>Base Layers</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve been skiing in SmartWool socks since I started skiing, and I will never ski without them. Socks are just as important as boots for warmth and comfort.</p><p>For base layers, I picked up a couple of additional bottom and top layers for different temperatures. For pants I picked up some 3/4 length stretch pants and 3/4 length insulated pants. I always seemed to have issues with the 1/4 of the pant that isn&rsquo;t in the boot bunching up around the top of the boot and causing pressure and a mild discomfort. 3/4 pants completely fix that so there isn&rsquo;t all that extra fabric. The stretch pants are like a thicker long underwear, made of the same material is a yoga pant, and the insulated pants are like a light down jacket, but for your legs. The insulated pants also had side vents just like my pants for dumping out excess heat if I got hot, and I was able to operate the zipper through the vent holes in my bibs. Both of these base layers acted as a set of a temperature regulators that I could use to perfectly keep my bottom half warm.</p><p>For my tops, I have a plethora of long underwear tops that I can wear to keep me warm. I have medium heat and high heat smart wool shirts and my 32° Heat thermal shirts. I also have my down jacket and sweatshirts that I can add in as additional layers to tune my insulation value. There weren&rsquo;t any days where I felt that I didn&rsquo;t have the necessary gear to keep myself warm.</p><ul class=image-gallery><li><a href=/post/2023-ski-season/images/smartwool_phd_ski_sock.webp title="Smartwool Ski Sock" class=lightbox-image><img src=/post/2023-ski-season/images/smartwool_phd_ski_sock_huf872f87ec0b3ac916264502ca4b68753_5456_250x250_fill_q50_h2_box_smart1_2.webp alt="Black Smartwool PhD Medium Ski Sock" title="Smartwool Ski Sock" width=250px height=250px>

<span>REI Down Jacket</span></a></li></ul><h2 id=travel>Travel</h2><p>For the majority of this season I drove my 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche. This is a four wheel drive truck that I have equipped with snow tires for the winter. The only time I didn&rsquo;t drive the truck were the rentals cars in Taos and Denver in January and a couple of times at the end of the year up to Tahoe. I only took 4 flights for skiing this year, all of them in January.</p><p>While in Colorado, the front right wheel bearing gave out and the truck needed to be towed to a shop and the bearing needed to be replaces. I had to scramble to handle that while also attending a work conference. Thankfully there was a shop in the neighborhood that was able to help me out that day.</p><p>At the tail end of the main road trip, the truck started to make some noise and I had to take it into a shop when I got home. The engine blew up to a known design issue and I had to put a new motor in it. Thankful that motor should be good for the next 3 years or 100,000 miles, since that is what the warranty is.</p><h3 id=accommodations>Accommodations</h3><p>I stayed in many hotels and accommodations for this season, totaling 72 nights away from home in 29 different locations. From all this travel, I ended up getting Marriott Titanium status and a couple hundred thousand points. Towards the end of the trip, I figured out how to settle into a hotel for longer periods of time, rather than the 2-3 days that I was doing at the start of the trip.</p><p>The trip last year taught us that there was a minimum level of hotel that Mariah and I were willing to stay at, but we had much fewer data points to compare against. The additional places this year drove in what style accommodations we were comfortable with and which things we didn&rsquo;t actually need. You can see that most of the hotels at the end of the trip were Marriott hotels, but I also book stays through HotelTonight and VRBO if needed.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Accommodation</th><th>Location</th><th>Nights</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Condo</td><td>Taos, NM</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel Don Fernando de Taos</td><td>Taos, NM</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Airport Sheraton</td><td>Albuquerque, NM</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Boulder University Inn</td><td>Boulder, CO</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Friend&rsquo;s Vacation House</td><td>Breckenridge, CO</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Element Denver International Airport</td><td>Denver, CO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Parent&rsquo;s House</td><td>Boise, ID</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>AmericInn</td><td>Hailey, ID</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Condo</td><td>Driggs, ID</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Anvil Hotel</td><td>Jackson, WY</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>TownPlace Suites</td><td>Layton, UT</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Fairfield Inn</td><td>Midvale, UT</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DoubleTree</td><td>Salt Lake City, UT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Embassy Suites</td><td>South Jordan, UT</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Fairfield Inn</td><td>Draper, UT</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Courtyard</td><td>Ogden, UT</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DoubleTree</td><td>Park City, UT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Residence Inn</td><td>Steamboat, CO</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Best Western Ptarmigan Lodge</td><td>Dillon, CO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Residence Inn</td><td>Denver, CO</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Magnolia Hotel</td><td>Denver, CO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hampton Inn</td><td>Silverthorne, CO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Courtyard</td><td>Glenwood Springs, CO</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Courtyard</td><td>Sandy, UT</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Inn at the Boatworks</td><td>Tahoe City, CA</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>SpringHill Suites</td><td>Truckee, CA</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Granlibakken</td><td>Tahoe City, CA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>BaseCamp</td><td>Tahoe City, CA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Condo</td><td>Mammoth Lakes, CA</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></div></article><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>&copy; 2024 Alex Norell.
