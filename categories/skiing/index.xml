It was awesome to spend so much time on the road and really learn what we like and don&amp;rsquo;t like.
I switched my pass this year to the Ikon Pass to get more days at the places I love and to expand the number of places that I am able to ski.</description></item><item><title>2022 Ski Season</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/2022-ski-season/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/2022-ski-season/</guid><description>We bought Mountain Collective passes for the third year in a row. The pandemic wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully over and we really wanted to do a road trip to hit all of the western US mountains. We had bought a truck after buying our house and were planning on using that to get around the mountains.

We had Mountain Collective Passes, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable traveling, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t travel for skiing until after Mariah had received her first vaccine shot. Due to all this, we only skied three times, and all of them at Palisades Tahoe.

We figured this would motivate us to explore and experience a variety of resorts instead of just sticking to our usual routine of driving up to Tahoe. It was an exciting way to jump back into my love for skiing while also turning it into an adventure for both of us.</description></item></channel></rss>
