These are some of the challenges that youâ€™d be solving.
Problem What tools/processes do you use for cloud infrastructure management, security, and auditing? We are a small, fast moving startup. With this in mind, how would you think about build vs buy? How would you construct a CI/CD pipeline on AWS with a React frontend, NodeJS backend, and pool of worker jobs?</description></item><item><title>Add Cloudfront to a Website</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-cloudfront-to-website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-cloudfront-to-website/</guid><description>The domain I&amp;rsquo;m using, norell.dev, requires the site to be served via HTTPS, or else the browser won&amp;rsquo;t display it. Google, the owners of the gTLD, requires HSTS for the domain.
From the get.dev page:
Your security is our priority. The .dev top-level domain is included on the HSTS preload list, making HTTPS required on all connections to .dev websites and pages without needing individual HSTS registration or configuration. Security is built in.</description></item><item><title>Add External Domain in AWS and create record for S3</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-external-domain-aws/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 21:21:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-external-domain-aws/</guid><description>I have a domain name, norell.dev that is registered outside of AWS. I would like to use it for my development within AWS, but Amazon doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the .dev domain name. Google is the gTLD owner, and Amazon and Google don&amp;rsquo;t play well together. Even though Amazon won&amp;rsquo;t let me transfer my domain to be registered in Route53, I can still configure it to be used using Hosted Zones.
I will follow this guide to get it set up.</description></item><item><title>Host Website in AWS S3</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/host-website-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 23:06:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/host-website-in-aws/</guid><description>I want to deploy a copy of this website to AWS S3, and set up all of the necessary infrastructure using terraform. This post will go over the steps that were taken to achieve this.
Set up provider This will be using AWS, so the terraform provider must be set. This will use the latest terraform version, 0.13.
The provider is defined below, and located in main.tf
provider &amp;#34;aws&amp;#34; { version = &amp;#34;~&amp;gt; 3.</description></item><item><title>Creating and Deploying This Website</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/creating-and-deploying-this-website/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/creating-and-deploying-this-website/</guid><description>A detailed explanation on how this website is generated and hosted.</description></item></channel></rss>
