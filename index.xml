I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on embedded linux systems and cloud platforms that have hundreds of thousands of daily users. In any project I work on, I focus on increasing the security posture using best practices.
In my off time, I enjoy skiing and adding to my home automation system. I have a home lab in my basement that I use for running a bunch of self hosted services and for learning about new software.</description></item><item><title>Resume</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/resume/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 12:03:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/resume/</guid><description>file PDF

The fan is fully controllable with Home Assistant using a couple ZWave relays.
System Design We went with a slightly oversized unit than our square footage and climate zone need. The unit we chose was the Quiet Cool QC ES-4700 which provides two speeds, high at 4,195 CFM and low at 2,304 CFM.</description></item><item><title>2023 Ski Season</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/2023-ski-season/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/2023-ski-season/</guid><description>The previous year we dipped our toes into the ski bum road trip lifestyle with a month long trip. It was awesome to spend so much time on the road and really learn what we like and don&amp;rsquo;t like.
I switched my pass this year to the Ikon Pass to get more days at the places I love and to expand the number of places that I am able to ski.</description></item><item><title>2022 Ski Season</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/2022-ski-season/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/2022-ski-season/</guid><description>We bought Mountain Collective passes for the third year in a row. The pandemic wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully over and we really wanted to do a road trip to hit all of the western US mountains. We had bought a truck after buying our house and were planning on using that to get around the mountains.
The Plan Road trip around the US Rockies in our truck Spend a longer period of time in each city The Truck We purchased a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado in July 2021 as a second vehicle mainly for the house projects we were planning on doing with our new house.</description></item><item><title>Interview: Startup Infrastructure Design</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/startup-infrastructure-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 09:57:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/startup-infrastructure-design/</guid><description>Prompt As we scale, we need to streamline our code deployment and infrastructure to be as efficient and robust as possible so that we can iterate quickly. These are some of the challenges that youâ€™d be solving.
Problem What tools/processes do you use for cloud infrastructure management, security, and auditing? We are a small, fast moving startup. With this in mind, how would you think about build vs buy? How would you construct a CI/CD pipeline on AWS with a React frontend, NodeJS backend, and pool of worker jobs?</description></item><item><title>2021 Ski Season</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/2021-ski-season/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/2021-ski-season/</guid><description>COVID-19 really screwed this year up for us. We had Mountain Collective Passes, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable traveling, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t travel for skiing until after Mariah had received her first vaccine shot. Due to all this, we only skied three times, and all of them at Palisades Tahoe.

The purpose of the event is to use known exploits on devices to retrieve information from within the device. This information is known as a flag and can really be anything; from the MD5 of a particular function, to the contents of a file in the system.
The CTF is set up as a 3 tiered network with vulnerable devices in each network.</description></item><item><title>State of the Desk 2021</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/desk-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 15:19:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/desk-2021/</guid><description>An overview of my home office desk.</description></item><item><title>Add Cloudfront to a Website</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-cloudfront-to-website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-cloudfront-to-website/</guid><description>The domain I&amp;rsquo;m using, norell.dev, requires the site to be served via HTTPS, or else the browser won&amp;rsquo;t display it. Google, the owners of the gTLD, requires HSTS for the domain.
From the get.dev page:
Your security is our priority. The .dev top-level domain is included on the HSTS preload list, making HTTPS required on all connections to .dev websites and pages without needing individual HSTS registration or configuration. Security is built in.</description></item><item><title>Add External Domain in AWS and create record for S3</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-external-domain-aws/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 21:21:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/add-external-domain-aws/</guid><description>I have a domain name, norell.dev that is registered outside of AWS. I would like to use it for my development within AWS, but Amazon doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the .dev domain name. Google is the gTLD owner, and Amazon and Google don&amp;rsquo;t play well together. Even though Amazon won&amp;rsquo;t let me transfer my domain to be registered in Route53, I can still configure it to be used using Hosted Zones.
I will follow this guide to get it set up.</description></item><item><title>Host Website in AWS S3</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/host-website-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 23:06:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/host-website-in-aws/</guid><description>I want to deploy a copy of this website to AWS S3, and set up all of the necessary infrastructure using terraform. This post will go over the steps that were taken to achieve this.
Set up provider This will be using AWS, so the terraform provider must be set. This will use the latest terraform version, 0.13.
The provider is defined below, and located in main.tf

That really was too much overhead for what I actually needed for this site.
A couple of the downsides:
Manual setup of the entire GCP instance No CI pipeline No CDN Expensive Manual Set Up I go over in my previous post, Creating and Deploying This Website. In summary, I was previously using the free tier of GCP to host a nano sized instance that contained nGINX and several static websites.</description></item><item><title>2020 Ski Season</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/2020-ski-season/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/2020-ski-season/</guid><description>This was the first year I got back into skiing after graduating from college, and my wife and I decided to get Mountain Collective passes. We figured this would motivate us to explore and experience a variety of resorts instead of just sticking to our usual routine of driving up to Tahoe. It was an exciting way to jump back into my love for skiing while also turning it into an adventure for both of us.</description></item><item><title>Creating and Deploying This Website</title><link>https://alexnorell.com/post/creating-and-deploying-this-website/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alexnorell.com/post/creating-and-deploying-this-website/</guid><description>A detailed explanation on how this website is generated and hosted.</description></item></channel></rss>
