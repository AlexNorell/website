### Road Trip

We made the decission this year to do the road trip that we had been wanting to do the previous 2 years. The goal was to ski as many places as we could on our two passes and make our way up to Canada for a couple weeks. The road trip didn't have a set end date, but we had a rough plan of what we wanted to do.

1. Grand Targhee & Jackson Hole
1. Salt Lake City & Park City
1. Steamboat
1. Colorado I70
1. Crested Butte & Telluride
1. Fernie
1. Banff
1. Kicking Horse
1. Revelstoke
1. Whistler
1. Alaska
1. Seattle & Portland
1. Bachelor


#### Week 1 

We left San Jose Friday night and headed up to Tahoe for the weekend before continuing on to Boise.

{{< expandable-box title="January 20 - Heavenly, CA" vert="35,000ft" >}}
First day of the season and my first time skiing at Heavenly in a long time. I showed some friends around the mountain and overall had a great experience warming up for the season.

{{< expandable-box title="January 21 - Palisades, CA" vert="12,912ft" >}}
It was a rainy day at Palisades, with my gloves soaking through around noon. There was some fresh snow in the morning, but the rain ruined it pretty quickly.

#### Week 2

We made it over to Driggs for our annual Grand Targhee trip.

{{< expandable-box title="January 27 - Grand Targhee, WY" vert="14,966ft" >}}
Most of the day was spent lapping Blackfoot. It was pretty foggy on the top of the mountain and the trees off Blackfoot held the fog off.

{{< expandable-box title="January 28 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="26,330ft" >}}
This was the first time I was able to take my dad to Jackson Hole. We brought the whole crew and enjoyed day poking around the mountain. At the end, we ended up in the Mangy Moose to watch the Playoff game and enjoy some live music.

#### Week 3

We did one more day at Grand Targhee before parting ways with the group. We headed to Jackson to stay in town for the week and the rest of the group headed back to Boise. Jackson was just a pleasing as we remembered it and we even ended up going to a [Moose](https://snowkingsec.com/moose-hockey/) game. The town is such a weird place, with finance bros wearing cowboy hats and coastal people flying in to experience the _"rugged west"_.

{{< expandable-box title="January 29 - Grand Targhee, WY" vert="32,697ft" >}}
Final day in Targhee with the group. I got my highest recorded speed on skis here at 58 MPH when lapping the groomers off of the Colter lift.

{{< expandable-box title="January 30 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="22,690ft" >}}
Half day doing laps off Sublette.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 31 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="18,604ft" >}}
Town was covered in heavy clouds, but the mountain was a blue sky day. Total inversion in the valley. Had a good day lapping the Tram and Sublette with Mariah.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 2 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="26,493ft" >}}
We decided to learn how to use our Avalanche probes in the probe training park at the bottom of the Rendezvous bowl. We then spent the rest of the day lapping Thunder.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 3 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="4,077ft" >}}
Mariah and I split up because I wanted to do the tram and she didn't. She did 2 laps on the Gondola and then she was done skiing because her boots. I only got a single tram lap in. We then spent the afternoon getting her boots adjusted.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 4 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="10,284ft" >}}
Last day at Jackson for the year and I finally convinced Mariah to do Hoback with me. There was fresh snow, but it was dust on crust.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

#### Week 4

We made our way down to Utah for a week, starting out in Layton and then moving down to Sandy. Utah has yet to dissapoint me for snow quality and lack of lines. I was able to ski Park City for the first time, but didn't do much exploration of the huge mountain.

{{< expandable-box title="February 5 - Park City, UT" vert="12,284ft" >}}
A huge storm rolled through a dumped over a foot and more was coming down when I was there. Visibility was very low at the bottom of the mountain and I worked my way up to explore some of the expert terrain. I found a couple of good powder stashes off of Pioneer before making my way over to Jupiter. The terrain here was what I was looking for, steep with some good untouched powder. I definitly want to go back and explore the rest of Park City for the steeps and deeps.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 6 - Snowbasin, UT" vert="15,608ft" >}}
Fresh powder at Snowbasin. Got 5 laps in Strawberry, keeping as close to the sisters area as possible. The new lift makes getting out of Strawberry significantly eaiser, although I hadn't done any other method than Lone Tree from the top of the gondola before.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 7 - Solitude, UT" vert="8,248ft" >}}
The storm continued and dropped 20"+ of fresh snow. I got a late afternoon session in, dropping into Parachute with waist deep untouched powder.
