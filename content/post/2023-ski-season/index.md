description: A recap of the 2023 ski season including mountains visited, gear changed, and travel notes.
---

The previous year we dipped our toes into the ski bum road trip lifestyle with a month long trip. It was awesome to spend so much time on the road and really learn what we like and don't like.

I switched my pass this year to the Ikon Pass to get more days at the places I love and to expand the number of places that I am able to ski. It also didn't help that Altera removed their mountains from the Mountain Collective pass, taking away all the California mountains. I also felt a bit limited in the number of days I could ski with the Mountain Collective pass, only getting 2 days at each of the partner resorts. Ikon gave me unlimited at the Altera owned mountains and 7 days at the rest of the mountains I would want to ski.

Mariah stayed with the Mountain Collective, since she wasn't planning on coming on the whole road trip, but just flying in for a weekend at a time to join me. This worked out well, since it forced me to move around more than I would have otherwise.

## The Plan

This year's plan was to do a road trip on an even bigger scale than last year, with at least 2 months on the road and getting more days on the mountain. 

- Fly to Denver to ski with friends in Colorado
- Fly to Boise to pick up my truck
- Get back to Denver by the end of February for a conference
- Mariah would fly in and ski parts of the trip, but wasn't road tripping
- Slowly make my way back to California by the beginning of April
- Ski a bunch in California

## Ski Trip Log

I was able to make it to more mountains in a year than I have ever before and also ski at seven new mountain.

### Taos

We flew out to New Mexico to bring my dad back to Taos. The last time he was there was in the late 80s. We had a lot of fun showing him the city and the mountain.

A huge storm rolled in overnight for day 2 and multiple inches of fresh snow fell. I unfortunately forgot to pack enough contacts and couldn't ski. We got a late start getting up to the mountain so Mariah and my dad could ski. When we got there, the storm was still dumping snow. The winds were high and the temperature was low, so they only lasted 90 minutes before calling it quits.

{{< expandable-box title="January 14 - Taos Ski Valley, NM" vert="16,619ft" >}}
Decent conditions, but it was pretty cold. We spent a lot of time lapping 8, with a few runs on 7 and 4.

### Colorado Part 1

I flew to Colorado to take some friends skiing at Breckenridge. I ended up flying in a couple days early to also ski with my cousin who was attending CU Boulder. We did a day trip up to Winter Park. My friends came in the next day, and we drove up to Breckenridge 

{{< image-gallery images="images/winter_park.webp|Lift lines at Winter Park|Lines for Winter Park,images/jerks_breckenridge.webp|Friends at Breckenridge|Friends at Breckenridge,images/jerks_peak_6.webp|Top of Peak 6|Friends at the top of Peak 6 in Breckenridge" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 21 - Winter Park, CO" vert="9,483ft" >}}
Cold day with almost zero visibility. It had been over 15 years since the last time I had skied at Winter Park and I still remembered parts of the mountain. Had a blast skiing with cousin.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 23 - Breckenridge, CO" vert="15,449ft" >}}
Day 1 of skiing at Breckenridge with some friends. Partly Cloudy and a bit colder than the previous day. Most of them hadn't skied in a very long time. The day was spent mostly doing groomers and bunny hills to get everybody accustomed to skiing again. 
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 24 - Breckenridge, CO" vert="10,060ft" >}}
Day 2 of Breckenridge was a half day to get back to Denver in time for a hockey game. Blue Sky day. I brought them out of their comfort zone and took them to the top of Peak 6.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Idaho and Grand Targhee

We drove over to Driggs for what is becoming a tradition of late January skiing at Grand Targhee and on the way we stopped at Sun Valley. This trip has been growing in the number of people my Dad brings each year, and we always have a great time with his friends.

{{< image-gallery images="images/grand_targhee_mariah.webp|Teton Canyon at Grand Targhee|Alex and Mariah demonstrating the views from the edge of the new terrain at Grand Targhee" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 28 - Sun Valley, ID" vert="24,760ft" >}}
This was our first time at Sun Valley, and it is a really interesting mountain. A lot more vertical feet than I was expecting and the snow was decent for late January. The first run of the day was a thigh burner down Easter Bowl to get to over to Seattle Ridge. Got lost a couple times and almost ended up at the wrong base at the end of the day. 
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 29 - Grand Targhee, WY" vert="15,521ft" >}}
Very very cold day at the ghee. Well below freezing. Was able to go over and explore the newly opened terrain off the Colter Lift.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="January 30 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="5,919ft" >}}
Mariah and I split off from the rest of the group and headed over to Jackson Hole for a day
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Jackson

Mariah had a 6am flight out of Jackson on the 31st, so we split off from the group again for the last day, where they were planning on skiing Grand Targhee for a third day before heading back to Boise.

My plan was to drop her off, grab a coffee in town and then head up to the Mountain for a morning of skiing. That didn't end up happening due to some extreme cold temperatures. It was -20°F outside when I dropped her off at the airport. It didn't get above zero until 1pm, and I decided to just call it a wash and check into my hotel and go the next day.

{{< expandable-box title="February 1 - Jackson Hole, WY" vert="15,085ft" >}}
Did a couple tram laps and then poked around the other lifts off Rendezvous. 
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 2 - Jackson Hole. WY" vert="7,228ft" >}}
Got in a couple of late afternoon runs after a long day of work and meetings. My watch stopped recording for about 45 minutes, so it missed a couple runs off of the Bridger Gondola.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 3 - Jackson Hole. WY" vert="10,899ft" >}}
Last day in Jackson, but started a bit later like the other days. There was some fresh snow from the morning, so I just went around the mountain looking for some powder stashes. I found some a spot over off the Hoback and in Saratoga Bowl.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Utah Part 1

I drove down Salt Lake City and bounced around the greater area for a couple weeks. During this time, some co-workers and Mariah came into town separately to ski.

With my change to the Ikon pass this year, I was able to try out a bunch of resorts in Salt Lake City that I wasn't able to in the past. This gave me a reason to spend time up in Ogden to try out Snowbasin. Snowbasin was a such a welcome surprise, with it not being crowded at all and having great snow and terrain.

I was also able to venture up the Big Cottonwood Canyon for the first time to try out Brighton and Solitude. While I still prefer the Little Cottonwood Canyon more, Solitude has some very fun steeps, and I lucked out with a huge powder day.

For my final day in the Salt Lake City area I headed over to Park City and skied at Deer Valley. While I wasn't impressed with the mountain after having spent 2 weeks skiing the steeps of the other Utah resorts, the town itself was a fun experience.

{{< image-gallery images="snowbasin_powder.webp|Snowbasin Powder|Fresh powder at Snowbasin on No Name,images/snowbird_mineral_basin_alex.webp|Mineral Basin at Snowbird|Alex standing up looking down the mountain at Snowbird,images/snowbird.webp|Blue Sky at Snowbird|Blue Sky day looking over the Gad section at Snowbird,images/deer_valley.webp|Deer Valley|Base area of Deer Valley" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 4 - Snowbasin, UT " vert="13,530ft" >}}
First time at Snowbasin. It feels a lot like Sun Valley, with great food and upscale lodges. Terrain was good, with some interesting steep terrain. Everything in Strawberry was fun, but the run out at the bottom kinda sucks. Most of my runs were in Sister's Bowl with a few runs on John Paul.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 5 - Snowbasin, UT" vert="14,4379ft" >}}
Tried out some other parts of the mountain, with a focus mostly on the John Paul side. I also went up the little Gondola to the top of the Men's Downhill. It was a low visibility day, so there wasn't much to see.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 7 - Solitude, UT" vert="12,313ft" >}}
Brought some of my coworkers here for their first day skiing ever. They did afternoon lessons, and I spent the morning with them on the magic carpet and bunny hill giving them a head start in their learning. Spent the afternoon exploring the mountain and finding the steep spots. The stuff off Summit Express and Powderhorn are really interesting, but hard to lap efficiently.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 8 - Alta, UT" vert="7,071ft" >}}
Second day skiing with my coworkers. We worked in the morning and headed to Alta for an afternoon of skiing, getting on the mountain at 2:30. It was snowing heavily, so visibility was low.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 9 - Brighton, UT" vert="13,112ft" >}}
Third and final day skiing with coworkers in Utah, we went up to Brighton for a full day. We worked out of the bar in the morning and then headed out to ski in the afternoon. I really wasn't impressed with Brighton, both in terms of the terrain and the layout.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 11 - Altabird, UT " vert="16,993ft" >}}
Mariah came out to Utah to ski with me and we spent a full day skiing at Alta and Snowbird.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 16 - Snowbird, UT" vert="22,024ft" >}}
An afternoon at the Bird to burn off some work energy. Blue sky day.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 18 - Snowbasin, UT" vert="25,510ft" >}}
Back up at Snowbasin. Did a couple laps in Sister's Bowl and a couple laps off John Paul.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 19 - Snowbasin, UT" vert="14,897ft" >}}
Fresh snow for my last day at Snowbasin. A quick couple hours lapping No Name Peak with fresh snow.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 20 - Deer Valley, UT" vert="6,197ft" >}}
Got a very late start due to work, and was really unimpressed with the quality of the snow and the steepness of the terrain. Only spent an hour on the mountain.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Colorado Part 2

I needed to be in Denver by February 23rd, so I made my way from Salt Lake City and stopped in Steamboat for a couple nights. While in Denver, I went up to Copper with some coworkers to ski. On my way back out of Colorado I stopped in Glenwood Springs for a couple nights to ski at Aspen. Work was pretty hectic, so I didn't get to ski as much as I would have preferred in Colorado.

{{< image-gallery images="abasin_cornice.webp|Zuma Cornice at Arapahoe Basin|Looking up at Zuma Cornice at A basin,images/abasin_top_of_cornice.webp|Dropping in off the Cornice|Dropping in off the top of the Zuma Cornice at A basin,images/copper_mountain.webp|Copper Mountain|Selfie on the top of Copper Mountain" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 21 - Steamboat, CO" vert="16,107ft" >}}
First time at Steamboat and spent my time looking for steep. The groomed runs were really nice, and I should have spent more time appreciating them. The only steep I found was the Christmas Tree Bowl. The process to get into it was too much to get back into it.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 23 - Arapahoe Basin, CO" vert="9,916ft" >}}
My one and only day at the Legends this season. I did 3 laps off the Zuma cornice, 2 laps down Pali face, and 2 laps off Lenawee. Cloudy day with decent snow conditions.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="February 28 - Copper, CO" vert="14,038ft" >}}
Brought my coworkers up here for a day of fun on the slopes. This was my first day back at Copper in over 15 years and this was also the mountain I learned to ski on. We poked around as my coworker with the weakest ski skills got more comfortable. By the end of the day, the snow was coming down pretty hard.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 7 - Copper, CO" vert="12,508ft" >}}
Came back to Copper on my way out of Denver. I wanted to explore more of the mountain and get into some of the steep stuff. I ended up lapping Spaulding Bowl a couple times.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 8 - Aspen, CO" vert="11,929ft" >}}
First time at Ajax and I can understand the appeal for the wealthy. The lift is right in downtown, the mountain is almost all groomed blues, and the mountain was pretty empty. I had some problems with my goggles fogging up and freezing, so I didn't ski as much as I wanted. I also didn't end up having enough of a gap in my schedule the next day to get back to try out any of the other Aspen mountains.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Utah Part 2

On my way back to California, I stopped in Salt Lake city for a couple days of skiing. Mariah flew into ski too, and we hit up Snowbird and Snowbasin. On the way out of town, I got a quick day in at Alta too.

{{< image-gallery images="images/alta_greeley.webp|Greeley Bowl at Alta|Greeley Bowl at Alta,images/snowbird_cirque.webp|The Cirque at Snowbird|The Cirque at Snowbird,images/snowbird_mineral_basin.webp|Mineral Basin at Snowbird|Nice weather in the Basin,images/snowbird_porcupine.webp|Porcupine at Snowbird|A wild porcupine at Snowbird" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 11 - Snowbird, UT" vert="10,891ft" >}}
Full powder day at the Bird with a couple big laps off the Cirque. We also saw a porcupine.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 12 - Snowbasin, UT" vert="14,654ft" >}}
Mariah's first day at Snowbasin, so we needed to see the whole mountain. Everything from Sister's Bowl to John Paul.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 14 - Alta, UT" vert="10,919ft" >}}
Last day in Utah for the season and a powder day. I did a quick couple hours lapping Collins lift before heading back to California.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Return to California

I ended off the roadtrip with a stop in Tahoe, staying at the Inn at the Boatworks in Tahoe City. As for the skiing, the first day I was in California, all the resorts were closed due to the storm that rolled in the night before. I got a good three days of powder skiing before calling it and heading home.

By this time in the season, this had already been the deepest season in recorded history. There were 6ft snowberms on all the streets in the area.

{{< image-gallery images="images/tahoe_city_snow_berms.webp|Snow berms in Tahoe City|6ft tall snow berms surrounding the side walk in Tahoe City,images/palisades_avalanche_debris.webp|Avalanche Debris off Granite Chief|Rubble from an avalanche in the Granite Chief area of Palisades" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 16 - Palisades, CA" vert="11,843ft" >}}
Poked around the mountain to see how the snow coverage was. It was crazy to see how deep everything was. There was also a bunch of evidence of recent avalanches.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 17 - Alpine Meadows, CA" vert="7,786ft" >}}
A quick afternoon doing some laps down Scott Chute and Promised Land. 
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="March 18 - Palisades, CA" vert="21,689ft" >}}
First time taking the Base 2 Base between Alpine Meadows and Palisades. Had fun skiing Promised Lands and Scott Chute at Alpine and GS Bowl at Palisades. 
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Day Trips to Tahoe

We did a couple day trips up to Tahoe for skiing. Mariah and I went up for a day trip to pick up her ski pass for next season. The other trip was with my Coworkers to pick up their passes for the next year. Both days were blue sky days with amazing snow conditions for late April.

{{< expandable-box title="April 16 - Palisades, CA" vert="12,891ft" >}}
Showed Mariah some of my favorite runs on the mountain, including Tamara's and Headwall. We also got over to the Broken Arrow terrain in the afternoon and had some very nice snow.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="April 23 - Palisades, CA" vert="13,091ft" >}}
Showed my coworkers Palisades and Alpine Meadows. We started the day off with a Tram ride and a couple green laps in the High Camp section and a handful of laps off Shirley. I brought them over to Alpine Meadows and showed them the Sherwood area and Lakeview before heading back to Palisades.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Cinco de Mayo in Truckee

Mariah and I headed up to to Palisades for the Cinco de Mayo weekend and ended up with a surprise powder day. We stayed at the Spring Hill Suites in Truckee.

{{< image-gallery images="images/tahoe_cinco_de_mayo_visibility.webp|Alpine Meadows Visibility|Low visibility for Cinco De Mayo weekend,images/tahoe_powder_cinco_de_mayo.webp|Cinco de Mayo Powder|Fresh snow in May at Palisades" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 5 - Palisades, CA" vert="12,232ft" >}}
Fresh powder day at Palisades. Lapped KT22 5 times, with most of the laps on Tamara's. Only did a half day since we needed to run some errands and also celebrate Cinco De Mayo with some tacos and beer.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 6 - Alpine Meadows, CA" vert="6,498ft" >}}
Short day at Alpine. The storm came through and dropped the visibility to under 50ft. It was also pretty cold and Mariah was done after 90 minutes. Got some good turns through the trees off of Roundhouse.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 7 - Palisades, CA" vert="11,398ft" >}}
Blue bird day with fresh powder. Skied mostly Red Dog Ridge with a single run off of Broken Arrow.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Mammoth Mountain

I planned a team building event for our team in Mammoth Mountain. We rented a condo for 5 days and road tripped up and back. The snow was ridiculously good for that late in the season with the entire mountain still being open. Record breaking year all across California and we continued to take advantage of it.

{{< image-gallery images="images/mammoth_gondola.webp|Mammoth Gondola|Mammoth Mountain Gondola going over a ski run,images/mammoth_lines.webp|Lines in May|Lines at Mammoth mountain at the start of the day late in May" >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 17 - Mammoth, CA" vert="9,714ft" >}}
We got on the snow and got everybody's ski legs back under them. We started a bit late due to all the rental shops in town not opening until 9, when the mountain opened at 7:30. We skied until 1, exploring the groomed sections of the mountain while everybody got warmed up and accustomed to their rental gear.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 18 - Mammoth, CA" vert="8,436ft" >}}
Another half day, but expanding our terrain to a couple of runs off the Summit with Cornice and Skyline.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 19 - Mammoth, CA" vert="14,510ft" >}}
Half day, with a ton of fast groomer laps. Got a couple fast summit laps in too.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 20 - Mammoth, CA" vert="16,675ft" >}}
Went further out in the mountain, skiing off the backside for a couple laps and over on Cloud Nine for a couple laps.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="May 21 - Mammoth, CA" vert="11,795ft" >}}
I went out on the last morning alone to get 90 minutes of fast skiing in. Skied Wipeout Chutes and Huevos Grande.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

### Late Season Turns

The season wound down for us in June, where we really didn't feel like getting up to Tahoe every weekend to ski less and less snow. We decided to go up once in June to saw we skied in June and then again in July for closing day. It hopefully won't be the last time I can ski in Tahoe this late into the year.

{{< image-gallery images="images/june_4th_tahoe.webp|Skiing in June|Alex and Mariah skiing in June with a view of Lake Tahoe in the background,images/july_4th_chair.webp|Skiing on July 4th|Alex and Mariah skiing in July riding up the chairlift,images/july_4th_tahoe.webp|July 4th Cheer|Alex and Mariah skiing in July at the top of the mountain,images/july_4th_fit.webp|July 4th Outfit|Short shorts and matching pattern button up shirt with a bright colored hat standing in from of Lake Tahoe,images/july_4th_mid.webp|July 4th ski run|Narrow strip of snow to ski on for July 4th,images/july_4th_bottom.webp|Bottom of the ski run|The snow ran out and people are taking of their equipment to hike to the bottom." >}}

{{< expandable-box title="June 4 - Alpine Meadows, CA" vert="10,692ft" >}}
June sunshine fun. Beautiful blue sky day with the party shirt out. Warm conditions and soft snow.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

{{< expandable-box title="July 4 - Alpine Meadows, CA" vert="3,129ft" >}}
Absolute end of the season, with the last quarter of the run completely dirt. We got two runs in before calling it and heading down to Sacramento to spend time with friends.
{{< /expandable-box >}}

## Ski Gear

From the skis on my feet to the helmet on my head, gear is an important part of skiing. Here's the gear that made it possible for me to enjoy this season.

### Skis and Bindings

I've been skiing on  Volkl Mantra 102s with Look Pivot 14 bindings for the last 4 seasons. They still tackled everything I threw at them and then some. From ripping down groomers at high speed to getting into the fresh stuff after a storm, they handled it all beautifully.

Holding me to the skis the Look Pivot 14 bindings that have been flawless this entire time. They can be a bit difficult to reset after a fall, but they continue to give me the ski feel I am looking for as I slide down the mountain.

#### 2020 Volkl Mantra 102

{{< image-gallery images="images/volkl_mantra_102.webp|Volkl Mantra 102|A pair of Volkl Mantra Skis,images/look_pivot_14gw.webp|Look Pivot 14|Look Pivot 14 GW Bindings in Black" >}}

### Boots 

Just like the skis, I continued to ski with the Dalbello Panterra 120 and ZipFit liners I've been using since 2020. My feet hurt a couple more times this season than last season, but everything seemed to work out if I kept my boots tight.

{{< image-gallery images="images/dalbello_panterra_120_gw.webp|Dalbello Panterra 120|A side profile of the Dalbello Panterra 120 GW Boot.,images/zipfit_boot_liner.webp|ZipFit Boot Liners|Blue and red ZipFit boot liners with black mesh and blue straps." >}}

### Poles

My tried and true Goode G-Max poles are still with me with no signs of needing replacement. These poles are made out of a composite material that allows them to flex and feel almost indestructible. They are light weight and have handled every ski season I've used them since 2008.

{{< image-gallery images="images/goode_gmax_poles.webp|Goode G-Max Poles|Goode G-Max Poles showing grips basket and pole." >}}

### Helmet and Goggles

My goggles and Helmet didn't change this year either. I did end up picking up couple more lenses for the goggles before the season started to be more adaptable to different sun conditions.

I'm skiing with a Smith Vantage MIPS helmet and Smith 4D Mag Goggles. These form a great system with a ton of ventilation and protection. The goggles give almost 100% peripheral view, with most of the gain in the vertical direction. MIPS technology in the helmet is designed to help protect your brain during a twisting fall by allowing the interior of the helmet to twist at a different rate than the exterior. Thankfully I haven't had any big falls with my helmet yet, so I should be good to continue using it for the foreseeable future.

{{< image-gallery images="images/smith_vantage_mips_ski_helmet.webp|Smith Vantage MIPS|Black Smith Vantage MIPS ski helmet,images/smith_4d_mag_goggles.webp|Smith 4D Mag goggles|Smith 4D Mag goggles with Black Strap and Green Lenses" >}}

### Outer Layer

Between seasons I replaced almost my entire outerlayer system. I switched from my 686 Quantum Thermagraph pants to Flylow Baker Bibs. Having never skied in bibs before I just thought the normal operating behavior was snow going down your back in big pow days or during a fall. Little did I know the life changing magic of snow bibs. They're an overall that keeps snow out of your clothes and also add a ton of extra usable pockets. They've got a thigh pocket where I keep my Balaclava just in case I need it, and chest pockets where I keep my car keys, snacks and anything else I want to keep warm or safe inside my jacket.

For the jacket, I picked up a Backcountry Cottonwoods jacket. This is only a shell, but it is made of burly gore-tex fabric and feels very strong. I also got a jacket that had the pockets in the places that I wanted them, and didn't have a bunch of additional pockets. My requirements for pockets in a jacket is an exterior chest pocket for my phone, an additional exterior chest pocket for my goggles cleaning cloth, hand pockets for any additional things like snacks or trail maps, arm pocket for a pass, and vents to dump heat. Switching to only a shell gave me lot more control of how hot or cold I was going to be on any given day.

While in Utah the first time I did pick up an additional jacket that I use for extremely cold days, the Flylow Roswell Insulated jacket. I didn't get to wear this much during the season, but when I did, I was definitely warm and stayed warmer than I could accomplish with my down jacket and base layers.

Keeping my hands warm has always been a problem for me and I've been very happy with the gloves I bought last year, Hestra Fall Line Three Finger gloves. I also added in a pair of Hestra Ergo Grip Active gloves for warmer weather. They are a much thinner glove and the back is polyester to really aid in ventilation. I didn't expect to use them as much as I did, but they give a ton of dexterity and were a perfect temperature for nice days.

### Base Layers

I've been skiing in SmartWool socks since I started skiing, and I will never ski without them. Socks are just as important as boots for warmth and comfort.

For base layers, I picked up a couple of additional bottom and top layers for different temperatures. For pants I picked up some 3/4 length stretch pants and 3/4 length insulated pants. I always seemed to have issues with the 1/4 of the pant that isn't in the boot bunching up around the top of the boot and causing pressure and a mild discomfort. 3/4 pants completely fix that so there isn't all that extra fabric. The stretch pants are like a thicker long underwear, made of the same material is a yoga pant, and the insulated pants are like a light down jacket, but for your legs. The insulated pants also had side vents just like my pants for dumping out excess heat if I got hot, and I was able to operate the zipper through the vent holes in my bibs. Both of these base layers acted as a set of a temperature regulators that I could use to perfectly keep my bottom half warm.

For my tops, I have a plethora of long underwear tops that I can wear to keep me warm. I have medium heat and high heat smart wool shirts and my 32° Heat thermal shirts. I also have my down jacket and sweatshirts that I can add in as additional layers to tune my insulation value. There weren't any days where I felt that I didn't have the necessary gear to keep myself warm.

## Travel

For the majority of this season I drove my 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche. This is a four wheel drive truck that I have equipped with snow tires for the winter. The only time I didn't drive the truck were the rentals cars in Taos and Denver in January and a couple of times at the end of the year up to Tahoe. I only took 4 flights for skiing this year, all of them in January.

While in Colorado, the front right wheel bearing gave out and the truck needed to be towed to a shop and the bearing needed to be replaces. I had to scramble to handle that while also attending a work conference. Thankfully there was a shop in the neighborhood that was able to help me out that day.

At the tail end of the main road trip, the truck started to make some noise and I had to take it into a shop when I got home. The engine blew up to a known design issue and I had to put a new motor in it. Thankful that motor should be good for the next 3 years or 100,000 miles, since that is what the warranty is.

### Accommodations

I stayed in many hotels and accommodations for this season, totaling 72 nights away from home in 29 different locations. From all this travel, I ended up getting Marriott Titanium status and a couple hundred thousand points. Towards the end of the trip, I figured out how to settle into a hotel for longer periods of time, rather than the 2-3 days that I was doing at the start of the trip. 

The trip last year taught us that there was a minimum level of hotel that Mariah and I were willing to stay at, but we had much fewer data points to compare against. The additional places this year drove in what style accommodations we were comfortable with and which things we didn't actually need. You can see that most of the hotels at the end of the trip were Marriott hotels, but I also book stays through HotelTonight and VRBO if needed.
